## What is Elixir?

Elixir compiles to BEAM bytecode, the same as Erlang

BEAM bytecode runs on Erlang's VM

Note:
Erlang ("Ericsson language") was created by Ericsson, which has about 
a 35 percent global market share in the wireless network infrastructure.

Elixir was created by Jos√© Valim, a Rails core team member, in 2011.

Despite some of the stylistic similarities between Elixir and Ruby, 
it doesn't make sense to describe Elixir as `"functional Ruby"`

## elixir & erlang:

+ immutable
+ functional
+ process-based
<br/><br/>
### known for
+ concurrency
+ fault tolerance
+ distribution
+ high availability

Note:
Elixir is functional in the sense that Lisp is functional 
+ it adheres to the basic functional programming paradigms, but it does allow side effects
+ sending messages is a good example of the side effects allowed in elixir functions

## Things to know, part 1

+ `[]` is a (singly) linked list
+ `{}` is a tuple
+ `%{}` is a map

Note:
lists are stored in memory as linked lists; prepending elements is O(1) but finding the length is O(n).

because data types are immutable in elixir, the original tuple isn't changed.

tuples are stored contiguously in memory; finding the length is O(1) but changing elements is O(n) because it requires copying the tuple's entire contents to a new tuple.

## Things to know, part 2

+ no mutations
+ no methods, only modules
+ `=`
+ enumerating
+ function heads & guards
+ anonymous functions
+ `|>`

---

## Things to know, part 3

+ inside an iex session:
  + use `h ModuleName` & `h ModuleName.function` to access documentation
  + use `r ModuleName` to reload a module
+ use `IEx.pry` to stop execution inside a function (like ruby's `debugger`)
  + use `respawn` to continue execution from within pry

---

## Pattern Matching Extras

+ you can use the `^` operator to pattern match against a variable's value
+ if you don't care about a value in a pattern, you can use `_` to fill that space

Note:

(you can use the `^` operator to pattern match against a variable's value:)

if you don't care about a value in a pattern, you can use `_` to fill that space.

you can compile modules using the `elixirc` command in the terminal (e.g., `elixirc math.ex`)

you can also compile and run `.exs` files without creating a `.beam` file like so: `elixir math.exs`

inside modules, `def` creates public functions while `defp` creates private functions

functions can have guards

no `for` loops in elixir - only recursion!

but in general, use the `Enum` module, which has most of the normal functions in it (`reduce`, `map`, &c.)

`Enumerable` is similar to ruby's: the functions work with any data type that implements its protocol.

you can pipe the results of a function directly into another function using `|>`
