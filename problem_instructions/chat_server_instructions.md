# Chat Server

[demo from lecture](./demos/lecture_processes_demo.ex)

## 1. Create new app

Plan out the app. My plan, if you'd like to follow along, is as follows:

> We'll build out a one-room chat server, which will keep as its state a list of
> all the chat content that has been posted in that server. People will be able
> to post chat content to it and get a list of chat content from it by sending
> messages to this server.

> After that's working, we'll add structure to our messages and make sure that
> they have both a `content` field and a `name` field.

> Once we have chat content with user information attached, we'll make a
> Supervisor for this chat room. This will allow us to make sure that the chat
> room is always up - even if we kill that process, the Supervisor will start a
> new one in its place.

> Finally, we'll update our server so that it can host multiple chat rooms at
> the same time.

The rest of these steps will help guide you as you implement this plan.

We'll start by running `mix new chat_server`, which will create a new app
called `chat_server`.

## 2. Create the one-room chat server

### 2.1 Start by setting up the server to store state with a `loop` function.

The state should be in the form of a List, but let's not trust our users to
know that: define a `loop` function that receives no arguments and calls
`loop`, passing it an empty list as an argument.

Define a `loop` function that receives a state and waits to receive a message.
If the message matches the format `{:get, from}`, then send the state back to
the process that requested it and continue looping with the same state.

Test your code by running:
```
pid = spawn(fn -> ChatServer.loop() end)
send(pid, {:get, self()})
flush() # => should return []
```

### 2.2 Add the ability to store chat content

Add another message matching clause to your `loop` function. If the message
matches the format `{:create, msg}`, then continue looping with that content
added to your state.

Test your code by running:
```
pid = spawn(fn -> ChatServer.loop() end)
send(pid, {:create, "hello world"})
send(pid, {:get, self()})
flush() # => should return ["hello world"]
send(pid, {:create, "hello again"})
send(pid, {:get, self()})
flush() # => should return ["hello world", "hello again"]
```

## 3. Add Message struct

Define a module `ChatServer.Message` that contains a struct definition. The
struct defined for this module should have a `content` property and a
`username` property.

Now, if a user passes content to the chat server, create a new Message struct
with the `content` property set to that content.

If, on the other hand, a user passes in a Map with a `content` property and a
`username` property, then create a new Message struct using those passed-in
properties.

Test your code by running:
```
pid = spawn(fn -> ChatServer.loop() end)
send(pid, {:create, "hello world"})
send(pid, {:get, self()})
flush() # => should return [%ChatServer.Message{content: "hello world", username: "anon"}]
send(pid, {:create, %{content: "hello world", username: "gage"}})
send(pid, {:get, self()})
flush() # => should return [%ChatServer.Message{content: "hello world", username: "anon"}, %ChatServer.Message{content: "hello world", username: "gage"}]
```

## 4. Create chat server Supervisor

### 4.1 Refactor chat server into a GenServer

#### 4.1.1 `use GenServer`

Once we have refactored the chat server to implement the GenServer behavior, we
will be able to fit it into a supervision tree very easily.

First, add `use GenServer` to the top of the module's definition. This allows
GenServer methods to be used throughout this module. Write a `start_link/0`
function that returns `GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: :chat_room)`.

Test your code:
```
ChatServer.start_link # => {:ok, #PID<0.123.0>}
# this pid is your reference to that chat server
```

#### 4.1.2 Client API

Next, let's write some Client functions. These functions are the way that users
and other processes will interact with this module. Write:
+ A `get/0` function that returns `GenServer.call(:chat_room, {:get})`
+ A `create/1` function that receives `content` and returns
`GenServer.cast(:chat_room, {:create, content})`

#### 4.1.3 Server callbacks

Now that we have an Client API for this chat server, build out the server
side. Server functions include:
+ `init/1`, which receives the second argument from the call to
`GenServer.start_link`
+ `handle_call/3`, which receives the request, who it's from, and the current
state
+ `handle_cast/2`, which receives the request and the state, and isn't expected
to reply

The content of these functions will be largely the same as their counterparts
in the previous iteration.

Test your code using the following:
```
{:ok, pid} = ChatServer.start_link(:ok)
ChatServer.get() # => []
ChatServer.create("hello world")
ChatServer.get() # => [%ChatServer.Message{content: "hello world", username: "anon"}]
```

### 4.2 Create ChatServer.Supervisor

Create a new file, `chat_supervisor.ex`. It should contain the following code:
```
defmodule ChatServer.Supervisor do
  # allows this module to use all of the Supervisor module's functions
  use Supervisor

  def start_link do
    Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, :ok, name: :chat_supervisor)
  end

  def init(:ok) do
    # the child processes of this supervisor are one ChatServer
      # the second argument is a list of arguments that should get passed to
      # that module's start_link function
    children = [
      worker(ChatServer, [])
    ]

    supervise(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
```

Test your code using the following:
```
ChatServer.Supervisor.start_link
ChatServer.get() # => []
ChatServer.create("hello world")
ChatServer.get() # => [%ChatServer.Message{content: "hello world", username: "anon"}]
```

Bonus: Run `:sys.trace(ChatServer, true)` to get a debug trace of the
ChatServer process.

### 4.3 Testing process crashes

The main thing we would hope to get out of supervising processes is that a
process crash shouldn't crash the entire program. We can find processes using
`Process.whereis(process_name)` and kill them using `Process.exit(pid, :kill)`,
and in fact the entire program doesn't die:

```
ChatServer.Supervisor.start_link
ChatServer.get() # => []
ChatServer.create("hello world")
Process.whereis(:chat_room)
Process.whereis(:chat_room) |> Process.exit(:kill)
Process.whereis(:chat_room)
ChatServer.get() # []
```



## 5. Create multiple chat rooms

Now let's set up a way for our chat server to hold multiple chat rooms.

### 5.1 Update the Supervisor

Start by adding a `start_room/1` function to the Supervisor module. This
function will receive a name as an argument, and return
`Supervisor.start_child(:chat_supervisor, [name])`.

Change the supervision strategy from `:one_for_one` to `:simple_one_for_one` -
this strategy is better equipped to handle the dynamic creation of child
processes.

Add a line to `init/1` in the supervisor module with
`Registry.start_link(:unique, :chat_room)`. This starts a registry for the chat
server processes, as we will be creating a new process for each chat room.

### 5.2 Update the ChatServer

Write a function `via_tuple/1` that takes an argument `room_name` and returns
`{:via, Registry, {:chat_room, room_name}}` - an instruction to look up this
process by its room name in the `:chat_room` registry.

Next, add a `room_name` argument to each client-side function and replace each
instance of `:chat_room` with a call to `via_tuple(room_name)`.

Test your code with the following:
```
ChatServer.Supervisor.start_link
ChatServer.Supervisor.start_room "foo"
ChatServer.Supervisor.start_room "bar"
ChatServer.create "foo", "foobar"
ChatServer.get("foo") # => [%ChatServer.Message{content: "foobar", username: "anon"}]
ChatServer.get("bar") # => []
```

## 6. Celebrate

We've now created a chat server that can store and share chat content across
each of its multiple rooms.
